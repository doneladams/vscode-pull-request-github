## Architecture
This extension uses a handful of VSCode APIs, some of which are still being developed. Some features and bugs may require making changes to VSCode itself instead of the extension; these are tagged with `upstream/vscode`.

At a high level, the code in `src` is organized into:
- `authentication`: All code related to the authentication flow
- `common`: Any utility methods. This also includes the code for parsing git diff hunks and mapping comment positions
- `github`: Code that directly makes requests to GitHub
- `view`: The classes that contribute the tree views of the extension, and the `reviewManager` class which orchestrates switching into and out of "Review Mode"

The `preview-src` folder contains all of the code for the "Description" webview, the content shown when clicking on any of the "Description" nodes in the tree.

The entry point of the extension is `extension.ts`.

The VSCode APIs the extension uses to create or display UI are:
- `registerTreeDataProvider`: Creates the "GitHub Pull Requests" tree view and "Changes in Pull Request" tree view
- `createWebviewPanel`: Creates the "Description" page shown for each pull request
- `registerTextDocumentContentProvider`: Returns file contents when clicking on file changes within the tree view
- `registerDecorationProvider`: Adds the 'â—†' indicators to the explorer and contributed tree view that indicate a file has been commented on
- `reigsterStatusBaritem`: Adds the "Signed in" status bar item
- `registerDocumentCommentsProvider`: Displays ranges you can comment on within the editor and handles adding comments
- `registerWorkspaceCommentsProvider`: Displays the comments panel and handles navigation to files when selecting comments
